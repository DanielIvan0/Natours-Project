// BASIC RESPONSIVE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

// Fluid Layouts
/*
    To allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width (or even height).
    Use % (or vh / vw) unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport (usually layout).
    Use max-width instead of width.
*/

// Responsive Units
/*
    Use rem unit instead of px for most lengths.
    To make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically.
*/

// Flexible Images
/*
    By default, images don't scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that.
    Always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width property.
*/

// Media Queries
/*
    To change CSS styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints).
*/


// Layout types

// Float layouts
/*
    The old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the float CSS property. Still used, but getting outdated.
*/

// Flexbox
/*
    Modern way of laying out elements in a 1-dimensional row without using floats. Perfect for component layouts.
*/

// CSS grid
/*
    For laying out element  in a fully-fledged 2-dimensional grid. Perfect for page layouts and complex components.
